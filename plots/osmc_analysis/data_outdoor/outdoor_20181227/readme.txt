Monkey Coffin outdoor measurements

Date: 2018-12-27

Box version 20181219

Box mounted on "tower" costruction to keep it far away from the floor in order to avoid/delay echos from floor or other objects:

- Mid (VM752) at 2.80m above ground, no closer objects
- Tweeter 16cm above mid
- Woofer 23.5 cm below mid

Anechoic time:
- mid: T = 13.7 ms, cut-off frequency = 73 Hz
- tweeter: T = 14.6 ms, cut-off frequency = 69 Hz
- woofer: T = 12.3 ms, cut-off frequency = 81 Hz

Outdoor temperature approx. 1 deg.C.

Measured impedance curves of all drivers to check if their TSP are different due to the low temperature

Measured acoustic far field response with microphone 1m away from baffle for all drivers
- all drivers on axis (microphone centered in front of each driver)
- woofer at 30 deg. horizontal ("inside" only, as "outside" would be identical because woofer is mounted in the center of the baffle)
- mid and tweeter at 30 deg. horizoneal, both "inside" and "outside" ("inside" = microphone inside of the stereo triangle, assuming the mid+tweeter of both speakers are arranged "close" to each other).

Repeated some of the measurements when I thought there was some ambient noise that may have interfered with the measurement. Usually ambient noise did not cause any obvious artefacts.
